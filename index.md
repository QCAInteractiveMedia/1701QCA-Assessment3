Who's heart beat is being represented, yours or the creature's?
Perhaps it is shared. 
'Two products of a non-agent' highlights our basal depedency on a process we cannot control. Human agency is often viewed as what seperates us from the animal world, but this work argues you and the lizard are both a product of the passive process of a heart beat, the vice versa. The user places their finger in the heart box that links them with the creature. The limp creature is wirelessly animated, moving in time and supporting itself while the heartbeat is there. When it is removed, the creature no longer lives.

<!--- PROJECT VIDEO: Provide a still image from your video and a link to the video below. In that code, replace `missingimage.png` with the still from your video and the URL of the video where indicated. If you link to a password protected video, you must include the password in the document you submit through Learning@Griffith. Failing to have a video that we can access might lead to significant reduction in marks, potentially as much as if the video has not been submitted at all. --->
